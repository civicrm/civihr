      A request has been made to reset your CiviHR password. To reset your password, please click the button below. The link will take you to the systemâ€™s user page where you can enter a new password into the password fields. Once saved, this will be your new password to login to the site.
      <spacer></spacer>
      After setting your password, you will be able to login to CiviHR  by using the following credentials:
      <spacer></spacer>
      Username: {$username}
      <br/>
      Password: (the password you have just created)
      <spacer></spacer>
      Please note: The button below can only be used once to login. It expires after one day. Nothing will happen if it's not used - your password will not change if you do not reset it.

      Best wishes,
