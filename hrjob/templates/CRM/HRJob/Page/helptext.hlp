FTE stands for Full Time Equivalent. This is a useful measure for an organisation
that has people working part-time.
For a full-time person, FTE is always equal to 1.0, whereas for a part-time person,
the FTE will represent the fraction of standard hours that the person works on a
regular basis.<br/><br/>
E.g. if the standard working day at an organisation comprises of 8 hours, then a
person who regularly works for 8 hours each day would be considered to be full-
time and would have an FTE value of 1.0. A person who regularly works for only
4 hours each day would be considered to be a part-time person and would have
an FTE value of 0.5. If the organisation had 10 people, each with an FTE of 1.0
the actual headcount of full-time people would be 10 and the FTE headcount
(equal to actual headcount multiplied by the FTE value) would also be 10.
However, if the organisation had another 10 people who each worked part-time
with an FTE value of 0.5 the actual headcount of part-time people would be 10
while the FTE headcount would only be 5. Thus for an organisation that had a
total of 10 full-time people, and 10 part-time people (each with an FTE of 0.5) the
actual headcount for the organisation would be 20 while the FTE headcount
would be 15.
